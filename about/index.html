          <h1 id="aboutHeader"> Hi, my name is Ali </h1>

          <p> I am a designer, illustrator, and biomedical engineer who loves combining creativity and science. Previously, I worked as a Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation engineer where I built complex 3D and computational models of the human cardiovascular system based on patient-specific medical imaging data. During this time I began integrating my creative skills and engineering background with aims of moving into a career that combines my love of problem solving with visual design.  I am currenly working as a Visual Designer at Firebase in San Francisco..</p>

          <p> I am passionate about engaging in an environment where continuous learning is the norm. I am the type who, in middle school, taught myself Adobe Flash to make a silly Harry Potter game &#8212; and who more recently dived head first into Python to build tools to help deploy this very website.  I am convinced that if you put enough effort into it (and spend some quality time on Google), you can learn anything.</p>
